# Playground

This is a repository meant for practicing on the commandline. Since most folks are using Windows, we can use this repository as a Codespace for interacting with a Linux terminal.

To access the Linux terminal, we'll follow the same steps we did in class:

* Click on the green `Code` button on the GitHub repository page. ![green code button](/assets/green_code_button.png)
* Goto the `Codespaces` tab and click on `Create codespace on main` ![new codespace](/assets/new_codespace.png)

This should open up a new Codespace with a terminal that you can then use to follow along with the homework assignments throughout the class.
